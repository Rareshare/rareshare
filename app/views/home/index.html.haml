          <strong>Scientific equipment is expensive.</strong> Small biotech
          and technology companies don't have the kind of capital it takes to buy them for one-off tests.

          <strong>Rare Share connects you to institutions that have equipment and aren't using it.</strong>
          Tools and systems come pre-installed, calibrated, and ready for use.
